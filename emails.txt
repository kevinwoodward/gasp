Hi Kevin,

Recently I received a cease and desist notice from IMDb, so I had to stop the API. Unfortunately I don't have any plans of restoring it due to legal reasons, so I guess you have to look for other options.

Sorry for the inconvenience and kind regards,
Martin

Hi, I have been using your IMDb API as an integral tool in my university project, and I noticed that the site is down (403) and my requests are returning 404. Is this intentional or only temporary? I appreciate your work and response. Thanks, Kevin Woodward

Regarding the creator of the API and why it is down

That is understandable. Is the API open source? My university term ends this week and for grading purposes I would be incredibly grateful if there would be some way I could obtain access to a private version for personal use, git repo or anything of that nature. 

Thanks again,

Kevin Woodward

Hi Kevin,

I cannot give you the code just because these legal issues, but there are a few other IMDb APIs, which are actually pretty good. You can check on Google.

Kind regards,
Martin
